# Fast Finality

Fast Finality is a crucial feature of Irys, designed to provide a superior user experience through rapid and dependable transaction confirmation.

In the fast-paced world of decentralized applications, near-instant confirmation of interactions with onchain programs is essential. Irys ensures that when users interact with smart contracts or other onchain programs, their actions are either committed and finalized immediately or not at all. This eliminates uncertainties and delays often associated with blockchain transactions, providing users with confidence and security in their onchain interactions.

With Fast Finality, real-time applications such as decentralized finance (DeFi), AI-driven systems, and decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN) operate seamlessly. Users receive immediate feedback on their transactions and can make timely decisions based on confirmed onchain states. This feature significantly enhances the performance and reliability of applications built on Irys, positioning it as the premier platform for developers seeking to create responsive and dependable decentralized applications.
