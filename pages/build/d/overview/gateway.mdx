# Irys Gateway

The Irys Gateway indexes and serves data posted to the network.

## Indexing

To ensure that all transactions posted to Irys are easily searchable and accessible, the gateway indexes all transaction metadata. Whenever a user posts a transaction to Irys, the gateway detects it and adds it to its database.

While indexing, the gateway extracts transactions from each block and indexes the metadata. When a bundle is encountered, the gateway indexes all the transactions within. Similarly, if a manifest is found, the gateway indexes it. By indexing manifests, the gateway creates a virtual directory structure that mimics the original folder system. This allows users to access data using the URL format `https://testnet-gateway.irys.xyz/[manifest-id]/[file-name]`.

## Querying

Transaction metadata can be [queried](/build/d/querying/query-package) directly using the [Irys query package](/build/d/querying/query-package) a REST API or [GraphQL](/build/d/querying/graphql). This enables users to create tailored queries, such as searching for specific [tags](/build/d/features/tags) or addresses.

Irys supports adding custom metadata [tags](/build/d/features/tags) to each upload, these tags allow users to build data models, all queryable via GraphQL.

When a user posts a transaction to Irys, the gateway picks it up and stores it in its database. This allows the gateway to support optimistic GraphQL, meaning query results include both transactions seeded to miners as well as those expected to be seeded soon. This ensures users have access to the most up-to-date data and can use it to build real-time applications.

## Serving Data

When a transaction is seeded to miners, its header and data are stored separately. To access this data, users request it from a gateway. Because it can be complex, computationally heavy, and difficult for average
users to access data directly from miners, gateways are crucial in making [downloading
data](/build/d/overview/downloading) as simple as uploading.

When a user requests data from a given gateway, the gateway first checks its internal cache, serving the data from there if it's available. If not, the gateway then checks Arweave to see if the data is stored there. If found, that gateway retrieves the data and serves it to the user, caching it for future use and providing faster response times for frequently requested data.

If the data is not found on Arweave or the gatewayâ€™s local cache, the gateway checks Irys's optimistic cache to see if the data is available. By doing this, the gateway allows for instant access to data uploaded to Irys.

## Scaling

Gateways are a crucial component in Irys's scaling strategy. To effectively scale, it's important to separate read and write components so they can be optimized independently. In Irys's approach, bundlers handle writing while gateways handle reading.

## Gateway Schema / Endpoints

To download data from a gateway, use the transaction obtained during upload. The most commonly used gateway is `https://testnet-gateway.irys.xyz`, and the format used to download data is `https://testnet-gateway.irys.xyz/[transaction-id]`.

For example `https://testnet-gateway.irys.xyz/CO9EpX0lekJEfXUOeXncUmMuG8eEp5WJHXl9U9yZUYA`.
