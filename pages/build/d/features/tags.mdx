# Metadata Tagging

Irys supports attaching metadata tags to each transaction.

Tags can be used to:

- Categorize transactions, making it easier to [search for and retrieve relevant information](/build/d/graphql)
- Build [mutable references](/build/d/features/mutable-references)
- Inform web browsers how to render files

## Querying

Tags are indexed by gateways and are queryable using [GraphQL](/build/d/graphql).

## Content-Type

The Irys CLI automatically infers and sets the appropriate [`Content-Type`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types/Common_types) tag based on the file extension when uploading files and folders.

If your use case necessitates manual Content-Type tag setting, you can specify it during the upload process. Doing so will override the default behavior and apply the `Content-Type` you provided.

```js
// Your file
const fileToUpload = "./myImage.png";

// Add a custom Content-Type tag
const tags = [{ name: "Content-Type", value: "image/png" }];

try {
	const response = await irys.uploadFile(fileToUpload, { tags: tags });
	console.log(`File uploaded ==> https://gateway.irys.xyz/${response.id}`);
} catch (e) {
	console.log("Error uploading file ", e);
}
```

You can also add tags via the [CLI's](/build/d/storage-cli/installation) `-t` option, followed by a series of name / value pairs

```console
irys upload myImage.png -t tagName1 tagValue1 tagName2 tagValue2 -n testnet -t matic -w bf20......c9885307
```

## Additional Uses

You can add up to 20 tags to each transaction, enabling the construction of semi-relational models within your data.

A popular practice involves creating an `application-id` tag, this tag helps segregate your uploads from others.

```js
// Your file
const fileToUpload = "./myNFT.png";

const tags = [{ name: "application-id", value: "NFTs To The Moon" }];

try {
	const response = await irys.uploadFile(fileToUpload, { tags: tags });
	console.log(`File uploaded ==> https://gateway.irys.xyz/${response.id}`);
} catch (e) {
	console.log("Error uploading file ", e);
}
```
