# Bundlers

Bundlers "bundle" or group multiple transactions together into a single transaction before posting to the blockchain. Bundlers allow for infinite transaction scaling - allowing up to 2^256 transactions to be stored in a single bundle. 

Bundles consist of multiple transactions collated together and written to as a single transaction. Each transaction in a bundle is called a DataItem. A DataItem shares many properties with a regular data transaction, including owner, data, tags, target, signature, and id. However, it cannot transfer tokens and does not have a reward, as the top-level transaction covers the reward for all bundled data.

## Nested Bundles

Bundles can be nested within other bundles, theoretically allowing for unlimited levels of nesting. However, items within a nested bundle are not accessible through our GraphQL.
