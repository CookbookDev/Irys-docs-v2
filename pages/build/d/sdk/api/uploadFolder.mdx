# `uploadFolder()`

Uploads a group of files to Irys in a single transaction.

See:
- [`Irys`](./uploadFolder#irysuploadfolderfoldertoupload-tags): For uploading a folder on the server.
- [`WebIrys`](./uploadFolder#webirysuploadfolderfile): For uploading a folder from the browser. 

## `irys.uploadFolder(folderToUpload, tags)`


## Parameters

<ApiTable columns={[
	{ header: "Name", key: "name", span: 3 },
	{ header: "Type", key: "type", span: 2 },
	{ header: "Description", key: "description", span: 7 },
]} data={[
	  { name: "folderToUpload", type: "string", description: "Path to the folder being uploaded." },
		{ name: "indexFile", type: "string", description: "(optional) The name of an index file also included in the folder you upload. If provided, this index file will load when a user requests `https://gateway.irys.xyz/:manifestId`." },
		{ name: "batchSize", type: "number", description: "(optional) The number of files to upload at once." },
		{ name: "keepDeleted", type: "boolean", description: "(optional) Whether to keep now deleted items from previous uploads. When you upload a folder, the file names are indexed and saved. If you then re-upload that same folder, Irys will only upload new files added since the previous upload. In the case where you delete files from your source directory, this flag tells Irys whether to keep those deleted files in the index or remove them." },
]}/>


## Returns

<ApiTable columns={[
	{ header: "Type", key: "type", span: 2 },
	{ header: "Description", key: "description", span: 10 },
]} data={[
	  { name: "response", type: "object", description: "A JSON object with the following values." },
]}/>

```json
{
	id, // Transaction ID (used to download the data)
	timestamp, // Timestamp (UNIX milliseconds) of when the transaction was created and verified
	version, // The version of this JSON file, currently 1.0.0
	public, // Public key of the bundler node used
	signature, // A signed deep hash of the JSON receipt
	deadlineHeight, // The block number by which the transaction must be finalized
	block, // Deprecated
	validatorSignatures, // Deprecated
	verify, // An async function used to verify the receipt at any time
}
```

## Example

```js
const irys = await getIrys();

// Upload an entire folder
const folderToUpload = "./my-images/"; // Path to folder
try {
	const response = await irys.uploadFolder("./" + folderToUpload, {
		indexFile: "", // Optional index file (file the user will load when accessing the manifest)
		batchSize: 50, // Number of items to upload at once
		keepDeleted: false, // Whether to keep now deleted items from previous uploads
	});

	console.log(`Files uploaded. Manifest ID ${response.id}`);
} catch (e) {
	console.log("Error uploading file ", e);
}
```

## `webIrys.uploadFolder(TaggedFile[])`

Pass an array of `File` objects.

## Parameters


<ApiTable columns={[
	{ header: "Name", key: "name", span: 2 },
	{ header: "Type", key: "type", span: 2 },
	{ header: "Description", key: "description", span: 8 },
]} data={[
	  { name: "files", type: "TaggedFile[]", description: "Path to the folder being uploaded." },
		{ name: "indexFileRelPath", type: "string", description: "(optional) Your own throwaway JWK to use for signing (i.e if you want to use the same one for more than one set of uploads)." },
		{ name: "throwawayKey", type: "number", description: "(optional) The number of files to upload at once." },
		{ name: "seperateManifestTx", type: "boolean", description: "(optional) If true, the manifest transaction will be excluded from the bundle making its tags indexable and queryable." },
]}/>

## Returns

<ApiTable columns={[
	{ header: "Type", key: "type", span: 2 },
	{ header: "Description", key: "description", span: 10 },
]} data={[
	  { name: "response", type: "object", description: "A JSON object with the following values." },

```json
{
	id, // Manifest ID
	timestamp, // Timestamp (UNIX milliseconds) of when the transaction was created and verified
	version, // The version of this JSON file, currently 1.0.0
	public, // Public key of the bundler node used

	deadlineHeight, // The block number by which the transaction must be finalized
	block, // Deprecated
	validatorSignatures, // Deprecated
	verify, // An async function used to verify the receipt at any time
}
```

## Example

```ts
const webIrys = await getWebIrys();

const files: File[] = [];
const tags: { name: string; value: string }[][] = [];

// Set files and tags in your UI

// Convert to TaggedFile objects
const taggedFiles = files.map((f: TaggedFile, i: number) => {
	f.tags = tags[i];
	return f;
});

// Optional parameters
const uploadOptions = {
	indexFileRelPath: "./index.html",
	manifestTags: myTags,
	throwawayKey: myKey,
	seperateManifestTx: true,
};
const response = await webIrys.uploadFolder(taggedFiles, uploadOptions);
```

## Returns

A JSON object containing the following values. A receipt is also generated which can be retrieved using [`irys.utils.getReceipt(response.id)`](/build/d/sdk/api/utils-getReceipt)

```json
{
	id, // Transaction ID
	manifestId, // Manifest ID
	manifest, // The manifest
    txs, // An array of DataItems, one for each entry in the bundle
	timestamp, // Timestamp (UNIX milliseconds) of when the transaction was created and verified
	version, // The version of this JSON file, currently 1.0.0
	public, // Public key of the bundler node used
	signature, // A signed deep hash of the JSON receipt
	deadlineHeight, // The block number by which the transaction must be finalized
	block, // Deprecated
	validatorSignatures, // Deprecated
	verify, // An async function used to verify the receipt at any time
}
```

## Downloading

Files uploaded via `uploadFolder()` can be retrieved in one of two ways.

1. Creating a URL with the format `https://gateway.irys.xyz/:manifestId/:originalFileName`.
2. Creating a URL using the transaction ID of each individual file uploaded with the format `https://gateway.irys.xyz/:transactonId`

After a successful folder upload, two files are written to your local project directory `[folder_name].csv` and `[folder_name].json`. The example below highlights a folder called with a total of 5 files in it. The transaction ID for each file can be used to retrieve the uploaded data by forming a URL with the format `https://gateway.irys.xyz]/:transactionId`
