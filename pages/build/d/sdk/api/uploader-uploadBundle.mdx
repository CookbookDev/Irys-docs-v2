# `upload.uploadBundle(tx)`

Uploads an array of transactions as a bundle in a single transaction.

This function is provided for users who need to obtain each transaction's ID before uploading. However, most users will use [`irys.uploadFolder()`](./uploadFolder), an abstraction that handles the uploading, signing and bundling in a single function call.

## Parameters

- `data`: The data to upload
- `tags`: Optional [metatags](/irys-sdk/tags)

## Returns

- `receipt`: A receipt in the form of a JSON object with the following values:

```json
response = {
	id, // Transaction ID (used to download the data)
	timestamp, // Timestamp (UNIX milliseconds) of when the transaction was created and verified
	version, // The version of this JSON file, currently 1.0.0
	public, // Public key of the bundler node used
	signature, // A signed deep hash of the JSON receipt
	deadlineHeight, // The block number by which the transaction must be finalized
	block, // Deprecated
	validatorSignatures, // Deprecated
	verify, // An async function used to verify the receipt at any time
}
```

## Example

```js
const irys = await getIrys();
const maxTxs = 5;
const txs = [];

for (let i = 0; i < maxTxs; i++) {
	const newTx = irys.createTransaction(`hirys! ${i + 1}`, {
		tags: [{ name: "Content-Type", value: "text/plain" }],
	});
	await newTx.sign(); // ID is now set
	txs.push(newTx);
	console.log(`Tx created and signed, https://testnet-gateway.irys.xyz/${newTx.id}`);
}

try {
	const uploadReceipt = await irys.uploader.uploadBundle(txs);
	console.log(`All Txs uploaded.`);
} catch (e) {
	console.log("Error uploading bundle ", e);
}
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
	The transaction ID returned as part of the response is used to download the data, simply create a URL with the format
	`https://testnet-gateway.irys.xyz/[transaction-id].`
</Callout>
