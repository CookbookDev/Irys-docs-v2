# Connecting 

When using the chunking uploader, first create an `Irys` object and then follow that by requesting the chunked uploader using `irys.uploader.chunkedUploader`.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
	The chunkedUploader object reference must be updated before each subsequent upload, it can not be reused.
</Callout>

```js
let irys = await getIrys();

let uploader = irys.uploader.chunkedUploader;
```
