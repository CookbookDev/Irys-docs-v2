# `upload.uploadBundle(tx, bundleOptions?)`

Uploads an array of transactions as a bundle in a single transaction.

This function is provided for users who need to obtain each transaction's ID before uploading. However, most users will use [`uploadFolder()`](./uploadFolder), an abstraction that handles the uploading, signing and bundling in a single function call.

## Parameters

<ApiTable columns={[
	{ header: "Name", key: "name", span: 2 },
	{ header: "Type", key: "type", span: 4 },
	{ header: "Description", key: "description", span: 6 },
]} data={[
	  { name: "data", type: "(DataItem | Buffer | string)[]", description: "An array of transactions to upload" },
		{ name: "bundleOptions", type: "DataItemCreateOptions", description: "(Optional) Upload options, which includes [tags](/build/d/features/tags)." },
]}/>


## Notes

If a provided transaction is unsigned, the transaction is signed using a temporary (throwaway) key. 
This means transactions can be associated with a single "random" address. 

If a buffer is provided, it is converted into a transaction and then signed by the throwaway key. The throwaway key, address, and all bundled (provided + throwaway signed + generated) transactions are returned by this method.


## Returns

<ApiTable columns={[
	{ header: "Type", key: "type", span: 2 },
	{ header: "Description", key: "description", span: 10 },
]} data={[
	  { name: "response", type: "object", description: "A receipt as a JSON object with the following values." },
]}/>

```json
response = {
	id, // Transaction ID (used to download the data)
	timestamp, // Timestamp (UNIX milliseconds) of when the transaction was created and verified
	version, // The version of this JSON file, currently 1.0.0
	public, // Public key of the bundler node used
	signature, // A signed deep hash of the JSON receipt
	deadlineHeight, // The block number by which the transaction must be finalized
	block, // Deprecated
	validatorSignatures, // Deprecated
	verify, // An async function used to verify the receipt at any time
}
```

## Funding

Uploads of less than 100 KiB are are free. For larger uploads, you'll need to [fund your account first](/build/d/sdk/payment/fund). 

## Tags

You can add an optional array of tags in the `BundleOptions` object (see code example below)

## Example

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
	Use a token-specific version of `getIrysUploader()` to connect to an Irys Bundler before uploading. Choose [one from here](/build/d/sdk/setup).  
</Callout>

```js

const uploadBundle = async () => {
  const irys = await getIrysUploader();
  const maxTxs = 5;
  const txs = [];
  
  // First create and sign a group of transactions
  for (let i = 0; i < maxTxs; i++) {
    const newTx = await irys.createTransaction(`Hirys World! ${i + 1}`, {
      tags: [{ name: "Content-Type", value: "text/plain" }],
    });
    await newTx.sign(); // ID is now set
    txs.push(newTx);
  }
  
  // Or send an array of Buffers
  // If a Buffer is provided, it is converted into a transaction and then signed by the throwaway key
  // const txs: Buffer[] = [
  //   Buffer.from("This is transaction data 1"),
  //   Buffer.from("This is transaction data 2"),
  // ];

  try {
    const options = {
      // throwawayKey: undefined, // Optional, pass a JWK if you have a throwaway key
      bundleOpts: {
        tags: [
          { name: "application-id", value: "foo" }, // Add optional tags
        ],
      } 
    };
    const uploadReceipt = await irys.uploader.uploadBundle(txs, options);
    console.log(`All Txs uploaded.`);
    for (let i = 0; i < uploadReceipt.txs.length; i++) {
      console.log(`https://gateway.irys.xyz/${uploadReceipt.txs[i].id}`)
    }

  } catch (e) {
    console.log("Error uploading bundle ", e);
  }
}
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
	The transaction ID returned as part of the response is used to download the data, simply create a URL with the format
	`https://gateway.irys.xyz/:transactionId.`
</Callout>
