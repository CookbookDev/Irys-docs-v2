## Funding

Uploads of less than 100 KiB are are free. For larger uploads, you'll need to [fund your account first](/build/d/sdk/payment/fund). 

## Example

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
	Use a token-specific version of `getIrysBundler()` to connect to an Irys Bundler before uploading. Choose [one from here](/build/d/sdk/install-configure).  
</Callout>

```js
const irys = await getIrysBundler();

// Your file
const fileToUpload = "./myImage.png";

// Add a custom tag that tells the gateway how to serve this file to a browser
const tags = [{ name: "Content-Type", value: "image/png" }];

try {
	const response = await irys.uploadFile(fileToUpload, tags);
	console.log(`File uploaded ==> https://gateway.irys.xyz/${response.id}`);
} catch (e) {
	console.log("Error uploading file ", e);
}
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
	Use the transaction ID returned as part of the response to download the data by creating a URL in the format
	`https://gateway.irys.xyz/:transactionId.`
</Callout>
