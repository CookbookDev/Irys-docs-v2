## Funding

Uploads of less than 100 KiB are are free. For larger uploads, you'll need to [fund your account first](/build/d/sdk/payment/fund). 

## Example

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
	Use a token-specific version of `getIrysUploader()` to connect to an Irys Bundler before uploading. Choose [one from here](/build/d/sdk/setup).  
</Callout>

```js
const irys = await getIrysUploader();

const dataToUpload = "Hirys world.";
try {
	const receipt = await irys.upload(dataToUpload);
	console.log(`Data uploaded ==> https://gateway.irys.xyz/${receipt.id}`);
} catch (e) {
	console.log("Error uploading data ", e);
}
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
	Use the transaction ID returned as part of the response to download the data by creating a URL in the format
	`https://gateway.irys.xyz/:transactionId.`
</Callout>
