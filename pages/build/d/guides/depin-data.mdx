# Storing DePIN Data on Irys

DePIN networks need a reliable data layer they can trust. 

Imagine a network of nodes signing and reporting data onchain and a smart contract that reads this data to mint rewards. This setup only works if the DePIN protocol can easily verify that miners are storing the data they claim to store and that the data hasn’t been tampered with after being uploaded. Additionally, DePIN networks need to chronologically order data so they can process it in the order it was posted.

Irys makes this possible by providing permanent onchain data storage and millisecond-accurate timestamps. Protocols can verify data integrity, confirm that it's stored by miners, and ensure it remains unaltered.

Data on Irys can be accessed by protocols on any blockchain.

## Example

This guide includes example code showing how to store DePIN messages on Irys, how to tag and query those messages, and how to order them chronologically.

  Data messages for DePIN networks vary, but the core principles of secure storage, retrieval, and verification remain consistent across different use cases.

## Device Data

Example data for a weather sensor.

```json
{
  "device_id": "foo_device_001",
  "timestamp": "2024-08-29T12:34:56Z",
  "data": {
    "temperature": 22.5,
    "humidity": 60,
    "battery_level": 85,
    "location": {
      "latitude": 37.7749,
      "longitude": -122.4194
    }
  },
  "signature": "a4f8a2e8e7c4d2a7c3e1f9b6d8e2f1a0c5b7e6a3c4d1f7b8e2a6c1d3e7f8b9c2"
}
```

You can upload your DePIN data to Irys using the [Irys CLI](/build/d/storage-cli/installation):

```console
irys upload depin_data.json \
  -n testnet \
  -t ethereum \
  -w 6dd5e....54a120201cb6a \
  --tags Content-Type application/json \
  --provider-url https://sepolia.base.org
```

Or through the [Irys SDK](/build/d/sdk/installing-the-sdk):

```ts
import Irys from "@irys-network/bundler-client";

const uploadDePINData = async () => {
	const irys = await getIrys();
 
	const fileToUpload = "./depin_data.json";
	const tags = [{ name: "Content-Type", value: "application/json" }];

	try {
		const response = await irys.uploadFile(fileToUpload, { tags: tags });
		console.log(`File uploaded ==> https://gateway.irys.xyz/${response.id}`);
	} catch (e) {
		console.log("Error uploading file ", e);
	}
};
```

## Using Tags for Data Querying and Sequencing

Irys supports adding [metadata tags](/build/d/features/tags) to each upload, allowing you to categorize data and make it easily searchable. For DePIN networks, tags like `device-id`, `data-type`, `location`, and `application-id` can be attached to each upload. This makes it simple to filter data by criteria important to your network.

### Example Tags

Here’s how you might tag a data upload:

- `device-id`: "foo_device_001"
- `data-type`: "temperature"
- `location`: "San Francisco, CA"
- `application-id`: "DePIN Network Alpha"

```ts
import Irys from "@irys-network/bundler-client";

const uploadDePINData = async () => {
	const irys = await getIrys();
 
	const fileToUpload = "./depin_data.json";
	const tags = [{ name: "Content-Type", value: "application/json" },
                { name: "device-id", value: "foo_device_001" }
                { name: "data-type", value: "temperature" }
                { name: "location", value: "San Francisco, CA" }
                { name: "application-id", value: "DePIN Network Alpha" }];

	try {
		const response = await irys.uploadFile(fileToUpload, { tags: tags });
		console.log(`File uploaded ==> https://gateway.irys.xyz/${response.id}`);
	} catch (e) {
		console.log("Error uploading file ", e);
	}
};

### Querying Data by Tags

To query data stored on Irys, [you can use GraphQL](/build/d/graphql) to search [for specific tags](/build/d/graphql#tags) and [order the results by timestamp](/build/d/graphql#sorting):

```graphql
query getDeviceTemperatureData {
  transactions(tags: [
    { name: "device-id", values: ["foo_device_001"] },
    { name: "data-type", values: ["temperature"] },
    { name: "location", values: ["San Francisco, CA"] },
    { name: "application-id", values: ["DePIN Network Alpha"] }
  ], order: ASC) {
    edges {
      node {
        id
        tags {
          name
          value
        }
        timestamp
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This query retrieves all `temperature` data from `foo_device_001` located in `San Francisco`, and orders the results by the upload timestamp. 

By using tags and timestamps, you can ensure your DePIN network maintains accurate data sequencing and retrieval across any blockchain.
