## Free Uploads

Uploads below 100 KiB are free on Irys. This is a public good for users to be encouraged to try Irys. Uploads are rate-limited to 600 transactions per minute, with upload counts resetting every minute.

If you upload more than 600 transactions within a minute and have a funded balance, that balance will be used to pay for the transaction. If you don't have a balance, then you'll get a `402 - Free transaction limit exceeded, funds required` error.
