# Expired uploads

Paused uploads will expire after a period of inactivity. If you do need to recover an expired upload, use the following:

```js
const resumeData = uploader.getResumeData(); // Get the data required to resume the upload with a new instance
uploader.setResumeData(resumeData); // Set resume data
await uploader.uploadTransaction(dataItem); // Upload as normal
```
