# Setting upload parameters

## `setBatchSize()` and `uploader.setUploadSize()`

The default batch size (number of chunks to upload at once) is 5, the default chunk size (maximum chunk size) is 25MB. These values can be changed using the functions `uploader.setBatchSize(size)` and `uploader.setUploadSize(size)`.

```js
// Optionally change the batch size (default is 5)
uploader.setBatchSize(10);

// Optionally change the chunk size (default is 25MB)
// Value is in bytes
uploader.setChunkSize(500000);
```
