description: Uploads an array of transactions as a bundle

import { Callout } from "nextra-theme-docs";

# `upload.uploadBundle(tx)`

Permanently uploads an array of transactions as a bundle in a single transaction.

This function is provided for users who need to obtain each transaction's ID before uploading. Most users will opt to use [`irys.uploadFolder()`](/irys-sdk/api/uploadFolder), an abstraction that handles the uploading, signing and bundling in a single function call.

**Parameters**

<div className="-mt-6" />

- `data`: The data to upload
- `tags`: Optional [metatags](/irys-sdk/tags)

**Returns**

<div className="-mt-6" />- `receipt`: A receipt in the form of a JSON object with the following values:

```json
response = {
	id, // Transaction id (used to download the data)
	timestamp, // Timestamp (UNIX milliseconds) of when the transaction was created and verified
	version, // The version of this JSON file, currently 1.0.0
	public, // Public key of the bundler node used
	signature, // A signed deep hash of the JSON receipt
	deadlineHeight, // The block number by which the transaction must be finalized on Arweave
	block, // Deprecated
	validatorSignatures, // Deprecated
	verify, // An async function used to verify the receipt at any time
}
```

**Example**

```js
const irys = await getIrys();
const maxTxs = 5;
const txs = [];

for (let i = 0; i < maxTxs; i++) {
	const newTx = irys.createTransaction(`GM World! ${i + 1}`, {
		tags: [{ name: "Content-Type", value: "text/plain" }],
	});
	await newTx.sign(); // ID is now set
	txs.push(newTx);
	console.log(`Tx created and signed, https://gateway.irys.xyz/${newTx.id}`);
}

try {
	const uploadReceipt = await irys.uploader.uploadBundle(txs);
	console.log(`All Txs uploaded.`);
} catch (e) {
	console.log("Error uploading bundle ", e);
}
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
	The transaction id returned as part of the response is used to download the data, simply create a URL with the format
	`https://gateway.irys.xyz/[transaction-id].`
</Callout>
