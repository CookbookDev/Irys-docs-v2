	Atomic units refer to the smallest possible unit of a given cryptocurrency. In Ethereum, atomic units are called
	Wei, and they represent the smallest unit of Ether. Similar to how 1 dollar can be broken down into 100 cents, 1
	Ether can be broken down into 10^18 Wei. In Solana, atomic units are called Lamports, 1 SOL can be broken down into
	10^9 Lamports.
