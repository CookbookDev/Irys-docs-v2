# `irys.withdrawAll()`

Withdraws the the user's entire account balance. The unit is the `token` parameter supplied when creating the `Irys` object. If you have balances in more than one token, you must re-instantiate the `Irys` object for each token.

## Returns

- `response`: Either a 400 or 200 code:

```json
400 - something went wrong

200 - Ok
response.data = {
	requested, // the requested amount,
	fee, // the reward required by the network (network fee)
	final, // total cost to your account (requested + fee)
	tx-id, // the ID of the withdrawal transaction
}
```

## Example

```ts
try {
	const irys = await getIrys();
	const tx = await irys.withdrawAll();
} catch (e) {
	console.log("Error withdrawing funds ", e);
}
```
