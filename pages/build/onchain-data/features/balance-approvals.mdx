# Balance Approvals

Use balance approvals to share balances between multiple addresses. This helps to onboard users without requiring them to own tokens.

With balance approvals:

- You pay for transactions.
- Users sign transactions.

Balance approvals:

- Are based on the token set when connecting to an Irys node. Both approver and approvee must use the same
  token.
- Are registered instantly upon upload completion.
- Are non-transferable.
- Can be configured to expire automatically.

## Create an Approval

To update an existing approval, create a new approval with the same address (it will overwrite the existing approval).

```ts
const receipt = await irys.approval.createApproval({
	amount: irys.utils.toAtomic(1), // Amount in atomic units
	approvedAddress: "<address>",
	expiresInSeconds: 100, // Expires in 100 seconds. Delete to remove expiration.
});
```

## Upload Using an Approval

```ts
const receipt = await irys.upload("GM World", { upload: { paidBy: "<address>" } });
```

Combine approvals and tags:

```ts
const uploadOptions = {
	upload: {
		paidBy: "<address>",
	},
	tags: [{ name: "Content-Type", value: "text/plain" }],
};
const receipt = await irys.upload(dataToUpload, uploadOptions);
```

## Revoke an Approval

```ts
const receipt = await irys.approval.revokeApproval({ approvedAddress: "<address>" });
```

## Get Balances You're Approved To Use

Get approvals from the array of addresses provided:

```ts
const approvals = await irys.approval.getApprovals({
	payingAddresses: ["<address>"],
});
```

Get the first 100 approvals:

```ts
const approvals = await irys.approval.getApprovals({});
```

Return type:

```ts
{
	amount: string; // Amount approved in atomic units
	payingAddress: string; // Address of the payer's wallet
	approvedAddress: string; // Address of the wallet that received the approval
	expiresBy: number; // Timestamp (in milliseconds) when approval expires
	timestamp: number; // Timestamp (in milliseconds) when the approval was created
	token: string; // Approved token
}
[];
```

## Get Approvals You've Created

Get approvals for the array of addresses provided:

```ts
const createdApprovals = irys.approval.getCreatedApprovals({
	approvedAddresses: ["<address>"],
});
```

Get the first 100 approvals you've created:

```ts
const createdApprovals = irys.approval.getCreatedApprovals({});
```

Return type:

```ts
{
	amount: string; // Amount approved in atomic units
	payingAddress: string; // Address of the payer's wallet
	approvedAddress: string; // Address of the wallet that received the approval
	expiresBy: number; // Timestamp (in milliseconds) when approval expires
	timestamp: number; // Timestamp (in milliseconds) when the approval was created
	token: string; // Approved token
}
[];
```

## Get Balance Approvals via HTTP

You can also request balance approvals via HTTP:

**Testnet**:

```
https://testnet.irys.xyz/account/approval?payingAddress=<...>&token=<...>&approvedAddress=<...>
```
