# `toTimestamp(timeStamp)`


Use the [`fromTimestamp()`](./fromTimestamp) and `toTimestamp()` functions to search for transactions by timestamp. Results returned are `>= fromTimestamp` and `< toTimestamp`.

<div className="" />
**Parameters**
<div className="-mt-6" />
-   `timeStamp`: Timestamp as Date object or UNIX timestamp in milliseconds

You can search by passing `Date` objects to the functions:

```js
const results = await myQuery
	.search("irys:transactions")
	.fromTimestamp(new Date("2023-07-01"))
	.toTimestamp(new Date("2023-07-03"));
```

Or by using UNIX timestamps in millisecond format:

```js
const results = await myQuery
	.search("irys:transactions")
	.fromTimestamp(1688144401000)
	.toTimestamp(1688317201000);
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
	Irys timestamps are accurate to the millisecond, so you need to provide a timestamp in millisecond format. You can
	convert from human-readable time to UNIX timestamp using websites like [Epoch101](https://www.epoch101.com/), be
	sure to convert in **millisecond** format, not **second**.
