# `stream()`

Returns an iterable stream that continuously yields results as long as your query keeps producing them.

```js
// Create the stream
const stream = await myQuery
	.search("irys:transactions")
	.token("solana")
	.stream();

// Iterate over the results
for await (const result of stream) {
	console.log(result);
}
```
