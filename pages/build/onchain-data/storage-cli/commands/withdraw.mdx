# `withdraw`

Withdraws funds from either Irys's mainnet or devnet.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
Not all calls to `withdraw` will post immediately to your account, some blockchains are faster than others. When funding with AR, it can take upwards of 40 minutes before the balance post. For MATIC, ETH and SOL, balances will usually post in < 10s.
</Callout>

## Parameters

- `-n`: The network to check. Values are `mainnet` or `devnet` (if you omit, the default is `mainnet`).
- `-t`: The [token](/overview/supported-tokens) to withdraw.
- `-w`: Your [private key](/cli#using-private-keys).
- `--provider-url`: RPC URL to use. This is only required when using Devnet.

## Examples
