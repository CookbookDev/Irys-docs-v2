- `-w`: Your private key.
- `--index-file`: Name of the file to use as an index for manifests.
- `--provider-url`: RPC URL to use. 

## Example

```console

## Downloading

Files uploaded via `irys upload-dir` can be retrieved in one of two ways.

1. Creating a URL with the format `https://testnet-gateway.irys.xyz/[manifest-id]/[original-file-name]`.
2. Creating a URL using the transaction ID of each individual file uploaded with the format `https://testnet-gateway.irys.xyz/[transacton-id]`

After a successful folder upload, two files are written to your local project directory:

- `[folder_name].csv`
- `[folder_name].json`

The example below highlights a folder called with a total of 5 files in it. The transaction ID for each file can be used to retrieve the uploaded data by forming a URL with the format `https://testnet-gateway.irys.xyz]/[transaction-id]`
