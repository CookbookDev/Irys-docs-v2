# Programmability (Coming Soon!)

Our alpha testnet is live as of September 2nd, 2024, starting with support for permanent data uploads now and temporary data soon.

**Additionally, over the coming weeks, weâ€™ll be rolling out the [IrysVM](/learn/why-build-on-irys/irysvm) and [Programmable Data](/learn/why-build-on-irys/programmable-data).**


## IrysVM

As a fork of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), the Irys Virtual Machine (IrysVM) leverages the unique capabilities of the Irys blockchain by integrating access to its advanced storage layer, unlocking the potential for Programmable Data.

## Programmable Data

Programmable Irys unlocks a new paradigm where data can be actively used and manipulated in real-time by smart contracts. With Programmable Data, Irys integrates cost-effective data storage and smart-contract functionality, enabling dApps and services to interact programmatically with large amounts of onchain data within a single protocol and ecosystem. This streamlines development, lowers costs, and unlocks unprecedented composability, overcoming the limitations of fragmented integrations.
